# RoboVet iOS Starter (SwiftUI + WKWebView)

This starter gives you the key Swift files and templates to wrap your existing RoboVet web app in a native iOS shell using **SwiftUI + WKWebView**. 
Create a new Xcode **App** project (Swift, SwiftUI, iOS). Then replace/add files as described below.

## Steps
1. In Xcode: File → New → Project → iOS "App". Product Name: `RoboVet`. Interface: SwiftUI, Language: Swift. Disable tests for now.
2. Replace the autogenerated `RoboVetApp.swift` and `ContentView.swift` with the ones in this repo.
3. Add `WebView.swift` and `SafariView.swift` to the project.
4. Add the Info.plist keys from `Info.plist.additions.xml`. Merge into your `Info.plist` (right-click → Open As → Source Code, paste inside `<dict>`).
5. In **Signing & Capabilities**, enable:
   - Associated Domains (for Universal Links), e.g. `applinks:dascient.com` and your workers domain if needed.
   - Push Notifications (if you plan to use APNs).
6. In **Targets → RoboVet → Info** set **Supports multiple windows** to **NO** (optional for iPhone-only).
7. Build & run on device. Update the `START_URL` constant in `ContentView.swift` if needed.

## Universal Links (apple-app-site-association)
Deploy `apple-app-site-association` (no extension) to `https://dascient.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`.
Use the template in `apple-app-site-association.json` (rename on server without `.json`).

## Fastlane
Optionally use `fastlane` to automate TestFlight uploads. Update the placeholders in `fastlane/Appfile` and `fastlane/Fastfile`.

## Notes
- Keep your web app HTTPS-only to satisfy App Transport Security (ATS).
- Add only the permission keys that match features used by the website (camera for video calls, mic for voice, photo library for uploads, etc.).
