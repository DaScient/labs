# Labs

Welcome to **Labs** — an experimental playground by [DaScient](https://github.com/DaScient).  
This repository hosts prototypes, proofs-of-concept, and explorations across AI, data science, and computational research.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repo is designed as a collection of experiments and lab work.  
Each subfolder or module focuses on a different domain such as:

- **Machine Learning** — model training, evaluation, optimization
- **Data Science** — statistical exploration, visualization, pipelines
- **Generative AI** — creative experiments with large language models and diffusion systems
- **Quantum ML** — prototypes blending quantum computing concepts with data science
- **Systems & Tools** — utilities, infrastructure, and supporting code

The goal: to explore, test, break, and learn from the boundaries of current technology.

Running Experiments

Each lab module is self-contained.
Navigate into a folder and follow its instructions (often in its own README.md).

Example:
```bash
cd ml/experiment-01
python train.py

🧪 Philosophy

This repository is not production code. It’s a lab:
	•	Break things fast.
	•	Test hypotheses.
	•	Document discoveries.
	•	Share insights.

The focus is on curiosity-driven exploration over polished deliverables.
